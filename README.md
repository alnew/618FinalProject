# 618FinalProject
Time Series for Avocado Data

1. Motivation
For my Masterâ€™s Thesis, I helped create a large dataset from a Meraki dashboard containing data from wifi routers in European refugee camps, specifically ones located in Serbia and Greece. Included with the router data will be demographic data from UNHCR reports including: population amount, gender, nationality, and adult and child population per refugee camp. This data is being stored in a MySQL database. Due to the thesis data not being complete at the time of the initial project proposal, I decided to find a dataset that would allow for similar analyses and predictions. For this project, I chose the Avocado Prices dataset from Kaggle as it has similar enough type of features.
Four Questions
1. Look at the general trends and time series plots for average price and total average volume sold in
all the regions. What are the trends? Is the data normal? Is there stationarity?
2. What is the forecast of total volume of avocados sold for conventional and organic avocados?
3. Does the data demonstrate seasonality?
4. Are sales prices statistically significant between two cities?
